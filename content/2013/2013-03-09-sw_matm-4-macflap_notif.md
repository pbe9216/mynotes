A few days ago I was performing a migration of our inter-switch connections from 1Gps single links to 4Gps aggregates, and this message appeared:

```
*Jun 23 04:58:11.888: %SW_MATM-4-MACFLAP_NOTIF: Host 0015.5d91.8502 in vlan 1 is flapping between port Gi0/20 and port Po1
```

Well&#8230; I shut the port Gi0/20 to have look at it&#8230;

After a few web searches, the most potential error was a loop:

Some of the port I used were originally 1G access ports. They were configured with portfast feature. Portfast disable spanning-tree checks and make the port move from blocking to forwarding state immediately.

However I plugged one cable on the wrong switch making a loop. STP was not able to react because of the portfast and the only errors that appeared were this MAC flapping messages.

It describes a MAC address that is continually changing between port Gi0/20 and Po1 in the MAC address table.

Thanks to the quick shutdown of the faulty port and the storm-control, the stability of the network was not endangered.  
This incident remained transparent for end users ðŸ˜‰

_Note: this is message could have many significations depending of your environment._
