**Why guarantee time synchronization across your network ?**

Time synchronization is very important in an IT environment . Firstly because it ensures that all employees and their devices (computers, phones...) have all the same time. Secondly because the operating systems and network devices must be synchronized for security reason: when you analyze and correlate log information, timestamps are very precious.

**NTP Protocol**

NTP stands for Network Time Protocol. The current version number is 4. This protocol will get the time from an external time source and will propagate it in the local area network. To retrieve the time, NTP will request high stratum time servers. Strata are a hierarchical division of time servers. Strata represent the distance from the time server in term of accuracy. For example, Stratum 0 is the most accurate time resource (it is composed of [atomic clock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_clock), satellites...). As we cannot ask directly stratum 0 devices, Stratum 1 is the most accurate time source. Stratum 1 is composed of servers directly attached to atomic clocks. Then you have stratum 2 servers querying stratum 1 servers and stratum 3 servers querying stratum 2 servers, and so on so forth.  
  
You can get a list of available time servers for you time zone at [http://www.pool.ntp.org/zone/us](http://www.pool.ntp.org/zone/us) or at [http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/StratumOneTimeServers"](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/StratumOneTimeServers).

![NTP stratum](/ntp-stratum.jpg)

To ensure client-server synchronization, NTP uses a round-trip delay time mechanism to calculate the time the request spend on the wire and the time it take to process it [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-trip_delay_time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-trip_delay_time).

[Because a picture is worth a thousand words](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/n/napoleon_bonaparte.html):

Note that NTP is sending UTC time (Coordinated Universal Time).

**NTPd**  
NTPd is the traditional NTP daemon on Linux systems. NTPd is used for both server and client use. For openBSD, you can get openNTPd [http://www.openntpd.org](http://www.openntpd.org/).
In the following article I detail the configuration of a NTP server and client running Debian Linux operating system.



**NTP operation modes**  
- Symmetric active: the server sends NTP updates to its clients or to other servers periodically. It actively provides synchronization and could also be synchronized.  
- Symmetric passive: a server in this mode waits a NTP message before synchronizing clients or being synchronized.  
- client: in this mode, a server or a workstation periodically sends messages to be synchronized.  
- server: this mode is activated on a server when a NTP client message is received  
- broadcast/multicast: used in local area network to provide time for the clients  
- manycast: used in redundant / complex scenarios (clients and servers use multicast and unicast messages, [http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/autocfg.html](http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/autocfg.html)

**Server configuration**

```# aptitude install ntp ntpdate
# cp /etc/ntp.conf /etc/ntp.conf.bak
# vim /etc/ntp.conf
```

```# /etc/ntp.conf, configuration for ntpd; see ntp.conf(5) for help

driftfile /var/lib/ntp/ntp.drift

# Enable this if you want statistics to be logged.
statsdir /var/log/ntpstats/

statistics loopstats peerstats clockstats
filegen loopstats file loopstats type day enable
filegen peerstats file peerstats type day enable
filegen clockstats file clockstats type day enable

# You do need to talk to an NTP server or two (or three).
#server ntp.your-provider.example
## Stratum 1 servers
server nist1-la.WiTime.net
## Stratum 2 servers
server ac-ntp1.net.cmu.edu
server ac-ntp0.net.cmu.edu

# pool.ntp.org maps to about 1000 low-stratum NTP servers. Your server will
# pick a different set every time it starts up. Please consider joining the
# pool: 
# server 0.north-america.pool.ntp.org iburst
# server 1.north-america.pool.ntp.org iburst
# server 2.north-america.pool.ntp.org iburst
# server 3.north-america.pool.ntp.org iburst

# Access control configuration; see /usr/share/doc/ntp-doc/html/accopt.html for
# details. The web page 
# might also be helpful.
#
# Note that "restrict" applies to both servers and clients, so a configuration
# that might be intended to block requests from certain clients could also end
# up blocking replies from your own upstream servers.

# By default, exchange time with everybody, but don't allow configuration.
# restrict default ignore ? forbid access for everyone, you need to add each server 
# manually
restrict -4 default kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery
restrict -6 default kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery

# Local users may interrogate the ntp server more closely.
restrict 127.0.0.1
restrict ::1

# Clients from this (example!) subnet have unlimited access, but only if
# cryptographically authenticated.
#restrict 192.168.123.0 mask 255.255.255.0 notrust
restrict 192.168.2.0 mask 255.255.255.0 nomodify notrap

# If you want to provide time to your local subnet, change the next line.
# (Again, the address is an example only.)
#broadcast 192.168.2.0

# If you want to listen to time broadcasts on your local subnet, de-comment the
# next lines. Please do this only if you trust everybody on the network!
#disable auth
#broadcastclient
```

Do not forget to set the timezone (NTP sends UTC time!)

```# rm /etc/localtime
# ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Americas/New_York /etc/localtime
```

or

```
# tzselect
```

Start the service:

```# /etc/init.d/ntp restart```

Verify:

```# ntpq -p remote refid st t when poll reach delay offset jitter

- t: type of the relation (unicast, broadcast, multicast, local)  
- when: when the peer was last heard (seconds)  
- poll: polling interval (seconds)  
- reach: status of the reachability  
- delay: latest delay in milliseconds

**Caveats** 
If there is too much delay between your time source and your server, it might raise an error saying that it cannot synchronize. It is advised not to set a stratum 1 or stratum 2 time source.
